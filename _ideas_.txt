Ideas:

* Macros -- be able to use select-play-select codes

* link to launch m.tivo.com

* displaying the NPL on the phone (via the NPL xml)

* a button to go directly to the now playing list would be nice

* visual display of what channel we are recording

* better application icon

* allow manually setting of an IP address and port (for crestron?)

* favorite channel list

* always connect to the last connected tivo

* whats playing -- and figure out a way to jump to that show.
